# ðŸ¤– getpressbot/images

This repository contains the bare docker images that are shipped with pressbot.
Using a github action, the CI will create variations of these images for each PHP version.

The images are available publically using `ghcr.io/getpressbot/pressbot`. Each package has the php version as its tag.
